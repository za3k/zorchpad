    22 pins (?)
    Can just use standard pitch headers

Requirements:

    9 pins (9 IO) - keyboard
    0 pins - power input
    7 pins (5 out, 2 IO) - SPI
        4 devices: Screen 1, Screen 2, MicroSD, E-ink
        4x chip select, 1 clock, 1 MOSI, 1 MISO
    2? pins (2 out) - Headphones
    0 pins - Microphone (integrated)
    GPIO (3 IO?)
        (shared clock with SPI)
